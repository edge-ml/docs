# Ubicomp Lecture Tutorial

### Introduction
This tutorial is intended for students participating in the Ubicomp lecture at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

In this tutorial we will show you:
- [How to install the Arduino IDE?]()
- [How to add the required support files for your Nicla Sense ME or Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to the Arduino IDE?]()
- [How to flash the edge-ml firmware on your Nicla Sense ME or Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense?]()
- [How to collect data with edge-ml and your Arduino board?]()
- [How to label data with edge-ml and your Arduino board?]()
- [How to train a classifier from edge-ml data in a Jupyter Notebook?]()

### Install Arduino IDE

### Add Board Support Files

### Flash edge-ml Firmware

### Collect Data

### Label Data

### Train Classifier
Now that you have collected some data and labeled different acitivities, please follow the steps in [this Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JeKOSQvd5xayBETpWO-uPHtiKgKmGjUv?usp=sharing) to train a classifier.
You will have to perform small changes to adapt the notebook to your specific dataset (sensors used) and labels.
Please find the detailed instructions directly inside the notebook.
