# Ubicomp Lecture Tutorial

### Introduction
This tutorial is intended for students participating in the Ubicomp lecture at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

In this tutorial we will show you:
- [How to install the Arduino IDE?](#Install-Arduino-IDE)
- [How to add the required support files for your Nicla Sense ME or Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to the Arduino IDE?](#Add-Board-Support-Files)
- [How to flash the edge-ml firmware on your Nicla Sense ME or Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense?](#Flash-edge-ml-Firmware)
- [How to collect data with edge-ml and your Arduino board?](#Collect-data)
- [How to label data with edge-ml and your Arduino board?](#Label-Data)
- [How to train a classifier from edge-ml data in a Jupyter Notebook?](#Train-Classifier)

### Install Arduino IDE
To install the Arduino IDE follow the specific instructions for your platform here:
- [Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows)
- [MacOS](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/macOS)
- [Linux](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux)

### Add Board Support Files

### Flash edge-ml Firmware

### Collect Data

### Label Data

### Train Classifier
Now that you have collected some data and labeled different acitivities, please follow the steps in [this Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JeKOSQvd5xayBETpWO-uPHtiKgKmGjUv?usp=sharing) to train a classifier.
You will have to perform small changes to adapt the notebook to your specific dataset (sensors used) and labels.
Please find the detailed instructions directly inside the notebook.
